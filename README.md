# Kaggle-Avazu-Competition
This repository contains some files used in the Kaggle Avazu click-through rate prediction contest to generate a single vowpal-wabbit model that scores ~0.393 on the private leaderboard. There are three files: a python script for munging the data, a python script for writing the predictions to a csv file suitable for submission to kaggle, and a shell script for running the python scripts, generating the model, and making the predictions.

The model scores 0.3952868 on the public leaderboard, and 0.3934794 on the private leaderboard, which places in the top 25%. Better results can be optained with further tuning or by ensembling.
