# Kaggle-Avazu-Competition
This repository contains some files used in the Kaggle Avazu click-through rate prediction contest to generate a single vowpal-wabbit model that scores ~0.393 on the private leaderboard. There are three files: a python script for munging the data, a python script for writing the predictions to a csv file suitable for submission to kaggle, and a shell script for running the python scripts, generating the model, and making the predictions.

During the competition this was run using a version of vowpal wabbit somewhere in the 7.6 range. The model scores 0.3952868 on the public leaderboard, and 0.3934794 on the private leaderboard, which is probably a decent score for a simplistic single model approach that can be implemented very quickly. My best score in this competition (0.3919847 on the private leaderboard, position 340) came from a simple weighted-averaging this model with another very basic model, an FM model using Stephan Rendle's libFM library. At some point I'll add the code for the ensemble.

The model scores 0.3952868 on the public leaderboard, and 0.3934794 on the private leaderboard, a reasonable result for a single model. My best model was obtained by ensembling this model with a simplistic libfm model.
